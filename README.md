# cpp-basic-data-manipulation
Basic manipulations in C++ of many data types, using object oriented programming
This takes in a string with data, parses and processes it using object oriented programming
Many data types are used and manipulated to create a useable, editable and simple database with some useful functions written in.

Not all functions are called in main{}, but they all have been tested and worked for me. 

This is just an example of my growing c++ skills.
